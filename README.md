# QuietTab Chrome Extension

**Tagline:** "Shut down noisy ads. Reclaim your browser. Instantly."

QuietTab is a Chrome extension that shows you exactly what's making your browser slow, hot, and loud - then fixes it with one click. Unlike traditional ad blockers that work invisibly, QuietTab is a **performance monitor with blocking capabilities** that gives you real-time visibility into resource-heavy scripts and provides instant relief without breaking websites.

## Features

### üîç Real-time Performance Monitoring
- Shows the top 3 resource-heavy scripts currently running on your active tab
- Visual indicators show relative impact with simple, user-friendly labels
- Identifies "Heavy Ad Scripts", "Tracking Networks", "Video Ads", and more

### ‚ö° Instant Quiet Mode
- **One-click performance relief** - the hero feature
- Automatically throttles the most resource-heavy non-essential scripts
- Provides immediate feedback with noticeable performance improvements
- Users should feel the difference immediately (fan stops, browser feels snappier)

### üõ°Ô∏è Safe & Smart Operation
- Prioritizes **throttling over blocking** to minimize page breakage
- Internal safelist protects essential scripts (payment, login, core functionality)
- Easy "Undo" functionality to restore normal operation if needed

### üìä Performance Impact Visualization
- Simple before/after indicators show resource usage changes
- Visual feedback reinforces the value delivered
- Color-coded impact levels (High, Medium, Low)

### When to Use Quiet Mode

- Your laptop fan starts spinning on simple websites
- Browser feels sluggish for no apparent reason
- Battery drains faster than expected during browsing
- Laptop gets hot from basic web browsing
- You notice excessive network activity from ads/trackers

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Uses Chrome's PerformanceObserver API for resource monitoring
   - Monitors network requests, long tasks, and resource usage
   - Identifies suspicious patterns in script behavior

2. **Script Throttling:**
   - Reduces execution frequency of resource-heavy scripts
   - Throttles animation frames from 60fps to ~20fps
   - Delays ad-related network requests
   - Pauses autoplay videos and reduces canvas update frequency

3. **Safe Operation:**
   - Maintains a safelist of essential scripts
   - Prioritizes throttling over complete blocking
   - Provides easy restoration of normal operation

### Browser Compatibility

- **Supported:** Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 compatible)
- **Permissions Required:**
  - `activeTab`: Monitor current tab performance
  - `scripting`: Inject monitoring scripts
  - `storage`: Save user preferences
  - `tabs`: Access tab information

## Troubleshooting
